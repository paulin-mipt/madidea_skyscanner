Skyscanner track project aimed to find a place to meet with friends.

## How it works

Suppose your friends are scattered over several cities in different countries, but you really want to meet somewhere.
Oh, and you are students so you want to find the cheapest way of doing that.

You fill your cities...

And the service gives you the cheapest trip suggestions based on Skyscanner flight data.
